The following CSS rule is attempting to select elements with the class "example" that are also descendants of elements with the class "container", but due to a typo, it won't work as expected.  The correct selector should use a space between the class selectors to indicate the descendant relationship. 

```css
.containerexample { /* Incorrect */
  color: blue;
}
```

Instead it should be written as:

```css
.container .example { /* Correct */
  color: blue;
}
```
